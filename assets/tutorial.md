# Tutorial: How to Play the 4x4 Marble Strategy Game

Welcome to the 4x4 Marble Strategy Game! This tutorial will guide you through the game mechanics, rules, and tips for mastering your strategy. Let’s get started!

## 1. Game Overview
The 4x4 Marble Strategy Game is a turn-based game for two players. Your goal is to place your marbles on the board and be the first to align four in a row—horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The twist? After each player’s turn, every marble on the board moves one cell counterclockwise!

## 2. Game Board Layout
- The game board consists of a 4x4 grid, creating 16 cells.
- The grid is conceptually divided into two regions:
  - **Outer Region**: The cells along the border of the grid.
  - **Inner Region**: The 2x2 grid at the center.

## 3. Game Flow
### Step 1: Player Turn
- Players take turns placing one of their marbles on any empty cell within the grid.
- Once placed, a marble cannot be moved manually by the players.

### Step 2: Marble Movement
- At the end of each turn, **every marble on the board moves one cell counterclockwise**.
- If a marble is on the left edge, it moves up; if it’s at the top, it moves right, and so on.

### Step 3: Winning Condition
- The first player to align four of their marbles in a straight line—horizontally, vertically, or diagonally—wins the game.

## 4. Game Strategies
### Plan Your Moves
Think ahead to not only place your marbles strategically but also anticipate how the counterclockwise movement will shift both your marbles and your opponent’s.

### Control the Board
Prioritize placing marbles in positions that can lead to multiple winning opportunities after rotation.

### Defensive Play
Pay attention to your opponent's placements and try to block their potential four-in-a-row formations.

## 5. Example Turn
1. **Player 1** places a marble at (2, 1).
2. **Player 2** places a marble at (3, 2).
3. After **Player 2’s turn**, all marbles on the board move one cell counterclockwise.

## 6. Tips for New Players
- **Practice Makes Perfect**: Familiarize yourself with how marbles move after each turn by playing a few practice games.
- **Adapt Your Strategy**: As marbles move automatically after each turn, be prepared to adjust your approach.
- **Watch Your Opponent**: Keep an eye on where your opponent places their marbles and how they may try to align four in a row.

We hope this tutorial helps you enjoy the game and sharpen your skills. Have fun playing!
